The phrase "preserve the time complexity per layer" refers to maintaining the same computational load or time taken for computation at each layer in the network. By doing this, the authors ensure that the network maintains a consistent level of computational effort across different layers, which can make the network more efficient and easier to manage.

In the context of the ResNet paper, they describe a strategy where if the feature map size is halved (due to downsampling operations like pooling or strided convolution), they double the number of filters. The main idea here is to balance the computational cost across different layers. 

When we halve the width and height of the feature maps, the number of elements (or activations) in those maps reduces by a factor of 4 (since area is proportional to the square of the length of the side). So, to keep the amount of computation the same, they double the number of filters. Since the computation cost is roughly proportional to both the number of elements in the feature maps and the number of filters, doubling the number of filters when the feature map size is halved leads to roughly the same overall amount of computation.

Preserving the time complexity is important because it allows for more efficient utilization of computational resources. By keeping the computation roughly equal at all layers, the resources (like CPU or GPU time) can be evenly distributed across the layers. This can help the network train more efficiently and make the training process faster, which is especially important for very deep networks like ResNet.

Balancing computational complexity across layers can have a noticeable effect on the performance and efficiency of training deep neural networks. The computational cost of a layer is related to the number of filters and the size of the feature maps it is processing. If a layer has too many filters or very large feature maps, it can be computationally expensive and slow down the training process.

By maintaining a balance, where the number of filters is increased when the feature map size is decreased, the ResNet authors aimed to keep the computational cost roughly the same at each layer. This leads to a more efficient use of computational resources, potentially speeding up the training process without sacrificing the expressive power of the network.

However, the effect on the actual performance of the network (in terms of accuracy on a test set, for example) is a separate issue. The architecture of ResNet, which includes elements like skip connections and batch normalization, along with its depth, are likely more significant factors in its strong performance on various tasks.

In short, the approach of preserving time complexity per layer is more about efficiency and speed of training rather than about improving the final accuracy of the model. However, a model that trains more efficiently can be a big advantage, as it allows for more experimentation and refinement in less time, which can indirectly lead to better performance.

When you mention "normal channel," I'm assuming you're referring to the channels in an image used as input to a neural network model for image classification. 

In a color image, we usually have three channels: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Each channel represents intensity values for that specific color. For a grayscale image, there's only one channel representing different shades of gray. 

The channels play a crucial role in image classification. They essentially provide the raw data or input that the neural network learns from. Here's how:

1. **Feature Extraction**: In the initial layers of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, the type typically used for image classification), the model learns to recognize basic visual features like edges and colors. Each channel of the image provides a slightly different view of the image, and combining these can help the model learn more complex features.

2. **Differentiating classes**: Certain classes of images may have unique characteristics in specific channels. For example, in a task to classify images of the sky, the blue channel might be particularly informative.

3. **Increasing Model Complexity**: Having multiple channels increases the dimensionality of the input data, allowing the model to learn more complex representations. 

It's worth noting that while RGB is the standard for natural images, different tasks may use different types of channels. For example, in medical imaging, it's common to see images with a single channel (grayscale) or sometimes many more than three channels (e.g., in multispectral imaging).

In summary, channels in image data are crucial for providing the raw information that the neural network learns from. They enable the network to extract features, differentiate between different classes, and learn complex patterns.
