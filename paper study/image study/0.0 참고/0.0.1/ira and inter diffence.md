1. **Intra-class**:
   - "Intra" means "within."
   - Refers to the variations or differences within the same class or category.
   - For example, in a dataset of images of cats and dogs, the differences between various images of cats (like different poses, colors, sizes) represent intra-class variations. These are the differences within the "cat" class.

2. **Inter-class**:
   - "Inter" means "between."
   - Refers to the differences or distinctions between different classes or categories.
   - Using the same example of cats and dogs, the differences between any cat image and any dog image represent inter-class variations. These are the differences between the "cat" class and the "dog" class.
