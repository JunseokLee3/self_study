Rendering, in the context of computer graphics and 3D modeling, refers to the process of generating a two-dimensional image or video from a three-dimensional scene. The scene is represented by data structures that describe 3D objects, lighting, textures, and other visual elements. The rendering process involves taking this data and calculating how each pixel of the output image should look based on the properties of the objects, the lighting, the viewpoint, and other factors.
