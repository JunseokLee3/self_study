1. **Depthwise Convolution:** In a depthwise convolution, a separate convolutional filter is applied to each input channel. This means that depthwise convolution operates on each channel separately and only mixes information within a single channel spatially (across width and height of the image or feature map). 

2. **1x1 Convolution (Pointwise Convolution):** A 1x1 convolution, on the other hand, is applied across all channels of the input but does not mix information spatially. Instead, it learns to mix information across channels. For each spatial location, a 1x1 convolution takes as input all channels and outputs a new set of channels, effectively learning a new representation that can combine information from all input channels.

By combining these two types of convolutions, a depthwise separable convolution first applies a depthwise convolution to mix information spatially within each channel, and then applies a 1x1 convolution to mix information across channels. This design separates the tasks of spatial feature learning (done by the depthwise convolution) and channel-wise feature learning (done by the 1x1 convolution).

Now, the operation of Transformers, especially in the context of vision Transformers, can be seen to have a similar separation of concerns:

**Transformers:** In Transformers, the self-attention mechanism allows for the mixing of information across all positions in the sequence (analogous to spatial mixing), but this happens independently for each feature dimension. Then, the position-wise feed-forward network (which applies the same linear transformation to each position independently) can be thought of as mixing information across the feature dimensions (analogous to channel mixing), but does so independently for each position.

So, the claim in the paragraph you quoted is that the combination of depthwise and 1x1 convolutions in CNNs and the combination of self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks in Transformers both perform a separation of spatial and channel mixing. However, each operation either mixes information across spatial or channel dimensions, but not both at the same time.


Let's start with a simple image processing example to illustrate how depthwise and 1x1 convolutions work:

1. **Depthwise Convolution**

Let's consider a 6x6 image with 3 color channels (RGB). When applying a depthwise convolution, we use separate filters for each channel. Let's say we use a 3x3 filter. This filter will independently traverse each channel, applying the convolution operation spatially (across the width and height) but not between channels. So, for each channel, we have an output that is a result of the spatial combination of values in that channel alone.

2. **1x1 Convolution**

After we get the output from the depthwise convolution, we can apply a 1x1 convolution, also known as pointwise convolution. This operation applies a single filter to each spatial location of the output from the depthwise convolution, but across all channels. Essentially, for each spatial position, it takes as input the output from all channels of the depthwise convolution, and combines these values into a new value for that position. This new value is a result of mixing information across channels, but not spatially.

Now, let's compare this to Transformers:

In the Transformer model, self-attention allows each position (or 'patch', in the case of Vision Transformers) to attend to all other positions, combining their information based on the attention scores. However, this operation is applied independently for each feature dimension. This is somewhat analogous to the depthwise convolution operation, where information is mixed spatially but not across channels (or features).

Then, there are feed-forward networks within each Transformer block, which apply the same linear transformation (a kind of mixing operation) to each position independently. This is similar to the 1x1 convolution operation, which mixes information across channels (or features), but not spatially.

This analogy isn't perfect, as the operations in Transformers and CNNs aren't exactly the same, but it helps to understand how both depthwise separable convolutions in CNNs and the operations in Transformers achieve a separation of concerns, with one operation handling the spatial (or positional) mixing, and the other operation handling the channel (or feature) mixing.




Consider a simple 4x4 image with 2 channels (we can think of it as a simple 2-color image). Let's represent each channel with a separate matrix:

**Channel 1:**
```
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6
4 5 6 7
```

**Channel 2:**
```
8 9 10 11
9 10 11 12
10 11 12 13
11 12 13 14
```

If we were to apply a depthwise convolution with a 2x2 filter, we would apply the filter separately to each channel. Let's use a simple 2x2 filter with all 1s for simplicity:

**2x2 Filter:**
```
1 1
1 1
```

After applying the depthwise convolution to each channel, we get:

**Channel 1 After Depthwise Convolution:**
```
 8 12 16
12 16 20
16 20 24
```

**Channel 2 After Depthwise Convolution:**
```
36 40 44
40 44 48
44 48 52
```

Now let's apply a 1x1 convolution to the result. In this step, we'll be using a filter that considers all channels, but for each spatial position separately. For simplicity, let's use a 1x1 filter with [0.5, 0.5] for the two channels:

**1x1 Convolution Result:**
```
22 26 30
26 30 34
30 34 38
```

As you can see, the depthwise convolution worked on each channel independently, applying spatial mixing within each channel, while the 1x1 convolution mixed the results across channels at each spatial position.

Now, compare this to the operations in a Transformer:

In a Transformer, for each input token, the self-attention mechanism considers all other tokens and computes an attention score for each one. These scores are then used to compute a weighted sum of the values of all tokens, which becomes the output for that token. However, this operation is applied independently to each feature dimension, which can be thought of as similar to the depthwise convolution operating independently on each channel of the image.

Then, the position-wise feed-forward network in the Transformer applies the same linear transformation to each token independently, effectively mixing information across the feature dimensions. This can be thought of as similar to the 1x1 convolution mixing information across channels.

So, in both the CNN with depthwise separable convolutions and the Transformer, we see a separation of operations that mix information spatially (across positions or channels) and operations that mix information across feature dimensions (across channels or token features), although the exact details of these operations are different in the two cases.
