The term "per-pixel mean subtraction" refers to the process of calculating the mean (average) value for each pixel position across the entire dataset and then subtracting this mean value from each pixel in the same position in each image. This is a common preprocessing step in many computer vision tasks, which can help to center the data and reduce the influence of illumination and contrast differences across different images.

Here's a simplified example:

Suppose we have a very simple dataset of two grayscale 2x2 images.

Image 1:

    10  20
    30  40

Image 2:

    50  60
    70  80

The per-pixel mean for this dataset would be:

    (10+50)/2  (20+60)/2   = 30  40
    (30+70)/2  (40+80)/2   = 50  60

Then, we subtract the per-pixel mean from each image to get the normalized images:

Image 1 after normalization:

    10-30  20-40  = -20 -20
    30-50  40-60  = -20 -20

Image 2 after normalization:

    50-30  60-40  = 20  20
    70-50  80-60  = 20  20

This is a simple example for illustration, and the actual process can be more complex when dealing with color images or larger datasets.

I hope this clears up any confusion. I apologize for the earlier mistake. Thanks for your patience.
