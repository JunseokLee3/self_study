The concept of a receptive field in a convolutional neural network (CNN) refers to the region in the input space that a particular CNN's feature is looking at (i.e., influenced by). In the context of the statement you provided, the "valid receptive field" refers to the actual area of the image that contributes to the final output of the network.

When a convolutional layer is applied to an input, it has a certain receptive field size, which is determined by the size of the convolutional kernel. For example, a 3x3 convolution has a receptive field of 3x3. When you stack multiple convolutional layers, the receptive field of the neurons in the deeper layers of the network increases, because each neuron in the second convolutional layer is connected to a 3x3 region of neurons in the first layer, and so on. This means that the deeper the layer, the larger the portion of the original input image it can "see".

However, the statement "the valid receptive field will decrease to some extent when the number of stacked 3 Ã— 3 convolutions keep increasing" suggests that after a certain point, increasing the number of stacked 3x3 convolutions does not effectively increase the receptive field. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **Vanishing Gradients**: As the network gets deeper, gradients passed back through the network during training can become very small, a problem known as the vanishing gradient problem. This means that the weights of the neurons in the earlier layers of the network are updated less and less, effectively meaning that these neurons "see" less of the input image.

2. **Overfitting**: Deeper networks have more parameters and are more complex, which can lead to overfitting. Overfitting means that the network is learning the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, which reduces its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

3. **Dilution of Information**: As information passes through multiple layers, some of it can get lost or "diluted". This means that the deeper layers might not have access to all the information from the input image, effectively reducing their receptive field.

The exact reason for this phenomenon can depend on many factors, including the specific architecture of the network, the data it's being trained on, and the training procedure itself. It's also worth noting that this is an area of ongoing research in the field of deep learning.
